## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Load data and create dataset}

data <- read.csv('/Users/alexlange/Downloads/DATS_Intro_to_Data_Science/general_sample_result_fixed.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ",")
corr_data <- data[,c("ra","dec","parallax","pm","pmra","pmdec","teff_gspphot","logg_gspphot","mh_gspphot","alphafe_gspspec","fem_gspspec","sife_gspspec","cafe_gspspec","feiim_gspspec")]
```

```{r Corner Plot}
pairs(corr_data,upper.panel = NULL)
```
```{r Ellipses}
data.cor = cor(corr_data,use="pairwise.complete.obs")
corrplot(data.cor,method="ellipse",type="lower",diag = FALSE,tl.col="black")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Significance test, echo=FALSE}
data.sig = cor.mtest(data.cor, conf.level= .95)
corrplot(data.cor,
         method = "number",
         type = "lower",
         diag = FALSE,
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         p.mat = data.sig$p,
         sig.level = .1,
         na.label=" ")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
